Module 10-Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: Team Profile Generator

We added  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
to the json file so we can just enter test at the command line to run testing.
Any time there is a repetitive action, add to scripts section.  If scripts
section doesn't exist, add it like we did here.

{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "inquirer": "^8.2.4",
    "jest": "^29.2.2"
  }
}
